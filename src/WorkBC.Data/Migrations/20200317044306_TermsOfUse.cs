WorkBC Job Board is an\r\n  Internet application that facilitates job seekers and employers in British\r\n  Columbia to connect online, free of any service charges.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  WorkBC Job Board specifically enables job seekers to view and, if desired,\r\n  be alerted to job advertisements free of charge at their own convenience,\r\n  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The following Terms of Use set out the terms and conditions under which\r\n  the WorkBC Job Board service (the \u201CService\u201D) is made available to you, the\r\n  job seeker (\u201CJob Seeker\u201D or \u201Cyou\u201D or \u201Cyour\u201D), to view job advertisements.\r\n  By clicking the \u201CI Agree\u201D box during the registration process and by\r\n  accessing, using and/or viewing jobs on WorkBC Job Board, you are indicating\r\n  your initial and ongoing acceptance and agreement to be bound by these Terms\r\n  of Use.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAREFULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n  2.0 <u>How the Service Works and Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</u>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The Service is designed to display job advertisements submitted directly to\r\n  WorkBC Job Board by employers as well as other current online job postings\r\n  as may be available from time to time. A Job Seeker may search any of these\r\n  job advertisements and use the contact information provided by employers in\r\n  those advertisements to respond directly to employers for jobs that are of\r\n  interest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  You may use the Service either as an anonymous Job Seeker (\u201CAnonymous User\u201D)\r\n  or, if you would like to take advantage of additional services, you may set\r\n  up a user account and become a registered Job Seeker (\u201CRegistered User\u201D). In\r\n  either case, you will be bound by these Terms of Use, to the extent applicable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Any personal information collected from you will be collected, used and\r\n  disclosed in accordance with the British Columbia Freedom of Information\r\n  and Protection of Privacy Act (\u201CFOIPPA\u201D) and for the purpose of providing\r\n  you with access to job search resources. The authority to collect personal\r\n  information comes from Section 26(c) of the FOIPPA. If you have any\r\n  questions about the collection of your personal information, please\r\n  contact: Manager, WorkBC and WelcomeBC Operations, 1-877-952-6914,\r\n  P.O.

Your\r\n    e-mail address may also be used to assist you if you forget your login\r\n    information.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n    In the event that you are accessing your account or the Service from\r\n    outside of Canada, you hereby consent to your personal information\r\n    being accessed from outside of Canada.

However, it is the Province\u2019s\r\n  policy that any job advertisement that falls within any of the following\r\n  categories must not be posted or may be removed, as the case may be:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements from placement agencies that charge fees to applicants\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    volunteer opportunities\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements where there are no available openings at the time of\r\n    posting\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements containing inappropriate, offensive or illegal content,\r\n    such as defamatory statements, inflammatory or discriminatory content or\r\n    hiring practices based on gender, sexual orientation, age, religious\r\n    affiliations, disability or ethnicity\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    any commercial solicitation and/or advertising other than for specific\r\n    employment opportunities\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements that require job seekers to participate in unpaid\r\n    training as a condition of hiring\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements for the recruitment of replacement workers during a\r\n    labour dispute\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    job advertisements for employment opportunities based outside of British\r\n    Columbia\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  If you should encounter a job advertisement that falls into any of the above\r\n  categories, you are asked to immediately contact the Province at 1-877-952-6914\r\n  and provide details of the offending posting so that it can be reviewed by the\r\n  Province.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Province will not have any liability for\r\n  any information posted by third parties, even if the Province has been\r\n  advised of any offending content in such information.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.0 <u>Duration of Job Advertisements</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  Job advertisements will typically be advertised on WorkBC Job Board for up\r\n  to 120 calendar days, unless otherwise determined by the job poster.\r\n  However, the Province will not have any liability for the earlier or later\r\n  termination of a job advertisement for any reason.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.0 <u>Condition of Use</u></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  By accessing and using WorkBC Job Board you agree that your use of this site\r\n  and the Service is entirely at your own risk and that you will be liable for\r\n  any failure to abide by these Terms of Use.
